# Enhanced Prompt Engineering for DEVCON Chatbot

## Overview

The prompt engineering system has been significantly improved to prioritize context-based responses and provide clear transparency about information sources.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Context Prioritization

- **Primary Source**: The chatbot now ALWAYS checks the provided context FIRST for relevant information
- **Fallback Strategy**: Only uses general knowledge when context is empty, irrelevant, or insufficient
- **Transparency**: Clearly indicates when using general knowledge vs. context information

### 2. Source Transparency

The chatbot now provides clear indicators about information sources:

#### When Using Context:

- "According to the documents..."
- "I found this in the materials..."
- "Based on the provided documents..."

#### When Using General Knowledge:

- "I don't have specific information about this in the provided documents, but based on general knowledge..."

### 3. Enhanced Prompt Structure

#### System Prompt Improvements:

- Clear instructions to check context FIRST
- Explicit fallback to general knowledge when needed
- Strong emphasis on source transparency
- Anti-hallucination safeguards

#### Context-Aware Prompts:

- Different prompts for scenarios with vs. without relevant context
- Specific instructions for each scenario
- Clear response requirements

### 4. Response Quality Indicators

The chatbot now adds indicators at the end of responses:

- ðŸ’¡ _This response is based on information found in the provided documents._
- ðŸ’¡ _This response is based on general knowledge about DEVCON and chapter management._

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Prompt Engine (`prompt_engine.py`)

#### New Methods:

- `create_enhanced_context_prompt()`: Handles both context and general knowledge scenarios
- Improved `create_context_aware_prompt()`: Better context detection and handling

#### Key Features:

- Context relevance detection
- Source transparency requirements
- Clear distinction between context and general knowledge usage

### LlamaIndex Service Updates (`llamaindex_service.py`)

#### Enhanced Query Processing:

- Better context detection logic
- Improved prompt integration
- Enhanced response formatting

#### New Features:

- `_create_basic_context_prompt()`: Fallback prompt when enhanced engine unavailable
- Better context vs. general knowledge detection
- Improved response quality indicators

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Context Available

**User Question**: "How should I run my chapter?"

**Response**:

```
According to the documents, DEVCON chapters should have regular meetings and events. Officers should communicate effectively with members...

ðŸ“š **Sources Referenced:**
1. Chapter Guidelines
2. Leadership Best Practices

ðŸ’¡ *This response is based on information found in the provided documents.*
```

### Scenario 2: No Context Available

**User Question**: "What is the weather like?"

**Response**:

```
I don't have specific information about this in the provided documents, but based on general knowledge, I can't provide weather information as that's not related to DEVCON chapter management...

ðŸ’¡ *This response is based on general knowledge about DEVCON and chapter management.*
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Prioritizes verified information from documents
2. **Transparency**: Users know exactly where information comes from
3. **Trust**: Clear distinction between context and general knowledge
4. **Reliability**: Reduces hallucination by emphasizing context-first approach
5. **User Experience**: Clear indicators help users understand response sources

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
cd server
python scripts/test_enhanced_prompts.py
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Confidence Scoring**: Add confidence levels to responses
2. **Context Quality Assessment**: Better evaluation of context relevance
3. **User Feedback Integration**: Learn from user feedback about response quality
4. **Dynamic Prompt Adjustment**: Adapt prompts based on conversation context
